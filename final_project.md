## 📘 Final Project Instructions

For the final project, you will identify a **Supervised Learning** problem to perform **EDA** and **model analysis**.  
The project has **140 total points**.

You will submit **three** deliverables:

---

### 📝 **Deliverable 1: Jupyter Notebook or Report**

A Jupyter notebook showing:

- Supervised learning problem description
- EDA procedure
- Model building and training
- Results
- Discussion/conclusion

💡 *If the project is too large for one notebook:*

- Submit multiple notebooks or scripts in a GitHub repo (see Deliverable 3)
- Or submit a report-style notebook or a PDF

💡 *If your project isn't suited for a notebook (e.g., an app using ML):*

- Write your approach as a report and submit it in PDF format

---

### 🎥 **Deliverable 2: Video Presentation (5–15 min)**

A video demo of your work (like a pitch). Focus on:

1. What problem you solve  
2. What ML methods or app methods you used  
3. Show the result or a live app demo

📁 Submit as an `.mp4`. Recommended length: ~10 minutes.

---

### 🌐 **Deliverable 3: GitHub Repository**

A public GitHub repository including:

- Your project code/work
- The URL included in your notebook/report and slides

---

### 📂 **Optional: Share Your Data/Video**

- Share data via **Kaggle dataset** or similar
- Share videos on **YouTube** or similar, and link them in your repo/blog  
🚫 *Avoid uploading large files directly to GitHub.*

---

### 🧪 **Grading Criteria Overview**

Each of your 3 deliverables will be reviewed by 3 peers based on a rubric.

## 🔁 Peer Review Expectations

As a future data scientist:

- Treat peers as colleagues
- Write code as if others will maintain it
- Use the report/video/repo to communicate clearly
- Review peers’ code as if you must collaborate with or build upon it

### 🧰 Instructions Summary

#### ✅ **Step 1: Gather Data**
(1 point)

- Choose a data source and problem
- Discuss your idea on the class forum  
- Sources include:  
  - [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)  
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
  - [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)  
  - [Grand Challenge](https://grand-challenge.org/)  
  - [List of ML datasets (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research)

📌 *You may also use your own data or data provided by an organization.*

> **Note:** Data cleaning is graded — using already-clean data may lose points!

---

#### 🔍 **Step 2: Define the ML Problem**
(5 points)

- Clearly describe your **supervised learning** task
- If using Kaggle or similar, go beyond replication — compare/contrast methods

---

#### 📊 **Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
(34 points)

- Describe features with plots (box, histogram, scatter, etc.)
- Analyze correlations
- Normalize or transform data if needed
- Detect outliers or missing values
- Highlight which features seem most important

---

#### 🤖 **Step 4: Modeling and Analysis**
(65 points)

- Build and analyze ML models
- Preferably compare multiple models and justify choices
- Include hyperparameter tuning where appropriate

(Optional) Include a web app demo

---

#### 📦 **Step 5: Final Deliverables**
(35 points)

- Submit polished notebook, video, and GitHub repo  
- This project is part of your **job portfolio**!
